        Tap proposes to increase the time a bartender gets to interact with customers by extending the service period outside of the bar. It's an app for bartenders to keep track of their customers, to contact them via SMS and check in and invite them to events and tastings they might like, or even just to say "Hi. Thanks for coming in last night."</p>

      <p class="paragraph">For this twelve week long project, we were tasked to design anything for an existing social group of our choice as the client.

    <p class="primer"> 
      Engaging with the people we were designing for in the early stages helped us uncover insights, clarify assumptions, and identify value paths that facilitated in design decisions. Field research through ethnography, cultural probes, and participatory workshops helped us understand and differentiate between what they say, do, and make so we could discover unmet needs.

        <span class="titles"> Ethnography </span> 
          Conducted over ten weeks, data was collected through on-site visits and observation, note taking, audio and video recording, photography, and informal interviews with bartenders and customers. As a result, we were able to identify behavioural patterns and reccuring themes that help define the culture around being a bartender.

        Each cultural probe contained 3 magnets with tabs to tally good, average, and bad days, 1 cocktail and bar-themed Mad Libs shareable notepad, 1 pen, 1 green and brown leather wallet for personal receipts, and 1 green leather bound personal cocktail recipe notebook. Upon receiving the cultural probe back after ten days of deployment, we conducted interviews and learned about with whom and how they spent their time and money.

          During both two hour sessions, participants were given a toolkit and instructed to assemble 2D and 3D collages based on a scenario given to them. Both participants were bartenders employed at Clough Club. The results helped us understand both participants as a bartender and as a customer. Not only did these generate insights that helped identify values paths that facilitate customer retention, but it also futhered our knowledge in the bartending culture.

    <p class="primer"> A good bartender knows it’s not about the drinks; it’s about the experience.<p>




     <div>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Bartenders have no way of developing service relationships outside of the bar. They rely on tips, but tips from the general public is often low and inconsistent. This means the highest tips often comes from regulars. 

        Sitting at the bar versus sitting anywhere else in the bar directly affects how much interaction a bartender has with their customers. Regulars are more likely to sit at the bar, interacting with the bartender, making them feel like the bartender deserves a greater tip.

        Building on newly found research and synthesis, we shifted from one design focus to another. These initial ideas were rejected because they failed to answer how it solves the problem and create meaningful experiences.

        <dd>Establish a bartender's credibility through their achievements and dedication towards experimenting new cocktail recipes.</dd>

        <span class="subheadings">Arriving at our Final Idea</span>
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        At which point in time during the customer journey are we trying to address? How will the product continually provide value over time? How does this address the problem? Does it help the bartender in any way? What do they need? When? We asked ourselves questions such as these to make sure we aren't designing for the sake of design, but each component in the end product works coherently to solve the problem.
      </p>

    <div>
      <p class="paragraph"> 
        <span class="titles"> Microtrends </span> 
          Designing for the near future meant looking at what trends were currently shaping design.

    </div>



    <div>
      <p class="paragraph"> 
        <span class="titles"> Lateral Thinking </span> 
          By connecting seemingly unrelated possibilities, we integrated the subscription model within the context of a bartender.

    <div>
      <p class="paragraph">
        <span class="subheadings">Wireframes & Early Iterations</span>
        <p class="primer"> Content first, then visuals. If the product doesn't work, lacks usability, nor deliver value, nobody is going to use it no matter how pretty it is.<p>
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph"> 
        <span class="titles"> Product and Design Considerations </span> 
          It is important to keep asking ourselves if what we're proposing to be included as part of the product delivers value and helps address the problem. If not, we filter it out. 
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph"> We initially thought of making an app for the customer as well, but realized it was unneccessary because they don't need another app on their homescreen just to communicate with the bartender.</p>

      <p class="paragraph"> Calender view. The aspect of keeping track of customers prompted a calendar at first, but which specific day a certain customer came in was not top priority information needed.</p>
