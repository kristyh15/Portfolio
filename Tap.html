        Tap proposes to increase the time a bartender has to interact with customers, by extending the service period outside of the bar. It's an app for bartenders to keep track of their customers, to contact them via SMS and check in and invite them to events and tastings they might like, or even just to say "Hi. Thanks for coming in last night."</p>
