        Tap proposes to increase the time a bartender has, to interact with customers, by extending the service period outside of the bar. It's an app for bartenders to keep track of their customers, to contact them via SMS and check in and invite them to events and tastings they might like, or even just to say "Hi. Thanks for coming in last night."</p>

          <p class="paragraph">For this twelve week long project, we were tasked to design anything for an existing social group of our choice as the client.

        <p class="subheadings"> Engaging with the people we are designing for in the early stages helped us uncover insights, assumptions, and identify value paths that facilitate in design decisions. Field research using methods of ethnography, cultural probes, and participatory workshops helped us understand and differentiate between what they say, do, and make so we can discover unmet needs.

Upon receiving the cultural probe back after ten days of deployment, we conducted interviews and learned about with whom and how they spent their time and money.

            During both two hour sessions, participants were given a toolkit and were instructed to assemble 2D and 3D collages based on a scenario given to them. Both participants were bartenders employed at Clough Club. The results helped us understand both participants as a bartender and as a customer. Not only did these generate insights that helped identify values paths that facilitate customer retention, but it also futhered our knowledge in the bartending culture.

    </div>

     <div>
        <p class="paragraph">Bartenders have no way of developing service relationships outside of the bar. They rely on tips, but tips from the general public is often low and inconsistent. This means the highest tips often comes from regulars. 

        Sitting at the bar versus sitting anywhere else in the bar directly affects how much interaction a bartender has with their customers. Regulars are more likely to sit at the bar, interacting with the bartender, making them feel like the bartender deserves a greater tip.

        <p class="paragraph">Building on newly found research and synthesis, we shifted from one design focus to another. These initial ideas were rejected because they failed to answer how it solves the problem and create meaningful experiences.

          <dt>Rejected ideas include:</dt>
            <dd>Establish a bartender's credibility through their achievements and dedication towards experimenting new cocktail recipes.</dd>

      <h3 class="heading3color-Tap">Arriving at our Final Idea</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">At which point in time during the customer journey are we trying to address? How will the product continually provide value over time? How does this address the problem? Does it help the bartender in any way? What do they need? When? We asked ourselves questions such as these to make sure we aren't designing for the sake of design, but each component in the end product works coherently to solve the problem.

      <p class="paragraph"> We initially thought of making an app for the customer as well, but realized it was unneccessary because they don't need another app on their homescreen just to communicate with the bartender.</p>

      <p class="paragraph"> Calender view. The aspect of keeping track of customers prompted a calendar at first, but which specific day a certain customer came in was not top priority information needed.</p>
